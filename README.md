# Minecraft React

a little minecraft clone written in TypeScript React with ThreeJs

## Usage

- You can play it using [the demo](https://konixy.github.io/minecraft-react) (sounds are not enabled in this version)
- I recommand you to clone the repository using `git clone "https://github.com/Konixy/minecraft-react` and then run `npm i` and finally run `npm start`, then you can go to <https://localhost:3000>
